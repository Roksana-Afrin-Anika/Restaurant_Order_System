# Restaurant_Order_System
This project implements a simple restaurant menu ordering system using Python. It allows customers to view the available menu items and place orders accordingly.
Menu Definition: The system defines a menu using a Python dictionary. Each menu item is paired with its corresponding price.

Displaying the Menu: Upon running the script, the system displays the menu to the customer. This provides transparency and helps customers make informed choices.

Order Placement: The system prompts the customer to enter their orders. It continues to do so until the customer decides to exit or reaches the maximum order limit.

Order Validation and Total Calculation: For each order entered by the customer, the system checks if the item is available in the menu. If it is, the system adds the price of the item to the total order cost. If the item is not available, the system notifies the customer.

Exiting the Order Loop: The system allows customers to exit the ordering process at any time by typing 'exit' or when they have reached the maximum order limit.

Total Order Calculation: Once the customer has finished ordering, the system calculates the total cost of the order and displays it to the customer.

Final Message: After displaying the total order cost, the system prints a message thanking the customer for their patronage, providing a courteous conclusion to the ordering process.

This project serves as a simple yet effective tool for managing restaurant orders in a streamlined manner. While it lacks advanced features found in commercial ordering systems, it provides a solid foundation that can be expanded upon with additional functionality and improvements.
